# Age and Gender Estimation Model: Analyzing IMDB Faces Dataset
Face Classification Model is a Final Project developed by Cecille Jatulan, Maria Melencio, Michael Montanez, David Higuera, and Diana Reyes, students of the Big Data Analytics program at Lambton College.

## Introduction:
The project focuses on analyzing the IMDB Faces Dataset to estimate the age and gender of individuals in the images. The IMDB Faces dataset contains a substantial number of face images collected from the IMDb website, a well-known online movie and TV show database. The dataset includes a wide range of actors and actresses with varying ages, ethnicities, and gender expressions, making it diverse and representative of real-world data. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, we aim to develop a custom solution that can accurately estimate the age and gender of individuals based on their facial characteristics.

## Business Domain and Problem:
In the Surveillance and Security industry, an accurate and efficient age verification model is developed to implement in security checks at places with age restrictions, such as bars, cinemas, and airports. The model utilizes the IMDb Faces dataset, a diverse collection of face images, to train a deep learning-based age estimation algorithm. During security checks, the system captures the face of an individual and passes it through the age verification model, which quickly estimates their age. The estimated age is then compared against the age restriction set for the particular venue, determining whether the person meets the minimum age requirement for entry or access. The model's accuracy and efficiency are crucial for smooth and reliable operations at these locations while ensuring compliance with age restrictions and privacy regulations.

## Need for a Custom/Differentiated Solution:
While there are existing age and gender estimation models available, a custom/differentiated solution is necessary for several reasons:

1. Relevance to Surveillance and Security Industry: The IMDb Faces dataset, although diverse and representative of real-world data, might not fully reflect the demographics and scenarios encountered in the Surveillance and Security industry. A custom solution allows for fine-tuning the age and gender estimation model on datasets more relevant to security check scenarios, improving accuracy in real-world surveillance conditions.

2. Optimal Performance: Accurate age and gender estimation are critical in security checks. Custom solutions can be tailored to excel in such scenarios, ensuring better performance and reliability compared to generic models.

3. Privacy and Compliance: Security checks involve capturing and analyzing individuals' facial data, raising privacy concerns. A custom solution can be designed with privacy and compliance in mind, ensuring responsible handling of data and adherence to industry regulations.

4. Efficiency and Speed: In security settings, quick and efficient processing of age and gender estimation is essential. A custom solution can be optimized for speed and resource utilization, enabling rapid analysis of faces during security checks.

5. Domain-specific Requirements: The Surveillance and Security industry might have specific requirements and constraints that generic age and gender estimation models may not meet. A custom solution allows tailoring the technology to address the industry's unique challenges and demands effectively.

6. Integration and Scalability: To implement age and gender estimation in real-world security systems, seamless integration and scalability are essential. A custom solution can be developed to fit into the existing security infrastructure and adapt to varying deployment scales.
